Computer codes for reproducing numerical results in the paper "A multi-compartment SIS stochastic model with zonal ventilation for nosocomial outbreaks", Risk Analysis, under review.

These computer codes allow one to reproduce Figures 1-5 and Table X. Results in Tables III-IX can be easily obtained by slightly modifying the outputs printed from these codes.

# A-multi-compartment-SIS-stochastic-model-with-zonal-ventilation-for-nosocomial-outbreaks
Computer codes for reproducing numerical results in the paper "A multi-compartment SIS stochastic model with zonal ventilation for the spread of nosocomial infections: detection, outbreak management and infection control", Risk Analysis, under review.

These computer codes allow one to reproduce Figures 1-5 and Table X. Results in Tables III, IV, VIII and IX are directly obtained when running codes Figure2.py, Figure3.py, Figure4.py and Figure5.py, respectively.
